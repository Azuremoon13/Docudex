There is a config chat command called `settings` for some settings in [Player Usage](../players/usage.md){: .md-button .md-button--primary .btn-small }

For chat commands there is also two ingame UIs for setup, one to create user groups to allow certain commands per user and another to edit/create commands, these UIs can be opened via a scriptcommand

In the user group UI you can set levels for players, Level 500 is the lowest level and everyone has by default, level 1 is the highest level. Players of higher levels can run any commands below their set level, Admins with cheats enabled with bypass any rank restrictions on commands

In the Chat command UI you have the ability to edit any of the default commands and/or add custom ones, each commands has a few options:

- `Name` - Name for the command
- `Description` - Description to show in `listcommands` UI
- `Level` - User Group level - default is 500
- `Chat Response` - The message for the command to send to the player in chat
- `Console Command` - The console command to run for the player (These are run server side so bypass admin checks with owning players controller passed)
- `MCI Tag` - The Tag for a mods singleton for ModComm
- `MCI Key` - Key used for SendModData ModComm
- `MCI Data` - Json string for SendModData ModComm
- `Cooldown` - Cooldown for command usage in seconds
- `Enabled` - Whether this command is enabled for player use
- `URL` - a URL for the player to open on their device (Requires confirmation from player before opening)

`Chat Response`, `Console Command`, `MCI Data` and `URL` will take placeholders for `{playerName}`, `{playerID}`, `{eosID}`, `{tribeID}` and `{tribeName}`. These are case sensitive.
